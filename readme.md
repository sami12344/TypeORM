## Installation

To get started with TypeORM in your project, follow these simple steps:

1. **Install TypeORM and Required Dependencies:**

   Open your terminal and navigate to your project's directory. Then, install TypeORM and the database driver you intend to use. For instance, if you're using PostgreSQL:

   ```sh
   npm install typeorm pg
   # OR
   yarn add typeorm pg
   ```

   Replace `pg` with the appropriate database driver package if you're using a different database.

2. **Configuration:**

   Create an `ormconfig.json` file in the root of your project. This is where you'll configure your database connection settings, entities, and more. Refer to [TypeORM Configuration](https://typeorm.io/#/using-ormconfig) for guidance.

3. **Create Your First Entity:**

   Define your first entity by creating a TypeScript class. An entity represents a table in your database. You can use decorators to specify columns, relationships, and more. Here's a simple example:

   ```typescript
   import { Entity, Column, PrimaryGeneratedColumn } from 'typeorm';

   @Entity()
   class User {
     @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
     id: number;

     @Column()
     username: string;

     // ... other columns and relationships
   }
   ```

4. **Start Using TypeORM:**

   Now you're ready to use TypeORM! Import the required functions from TypeORM to create repositories, perform database operations, and manage your entities.

That's it! You're set up to work with TypeORM in your project. For more advanced usage and configuration options, check out the [TypeORM documentation](https://typeorm.io/).


Feel free to adapt and modify this installation section according to your project's requirements and preferred level of detail.

## Usage

TypeORM makes working with databases a breeze, providing you with an intuitive and developer-friendly API. In this section, we'll cover some common usage scenarios to help you get started.

### Creating a New Entity

To create a new entity, define a TypeScript class with the appropriate decorators. Decorators like `@Entity()`, `@Column()`, and others help you define the structure of your database tables and columns. Here's an example:

```typescript
import { Entity, Column, PrimaryGeneratedColumn } from 'typeorm';

@Entity()
class User {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  id: number;

  @Column()
  username: string;

  // ... other columns and relationships
}
```

### Creating a Repository

Repositories are used to interact with your entities and perform database operations. To create a repository, you'll use the `getRepository` function provided by TypeORM:

```typescript
import { getRepository } from 'typeorm';

const userRepository = getRepository(User);
```

### Inserting Data

Inserting data into the database is straightforward. Use the repository's `save` method to create new records:

```typescript
const newUser = userRepository.create({ username: 'example' });
await userRepository.save(newUser);
```

### Querying Data

TypeORM provides a rich query builder that lets you construct complex queries in a programmatic way. Here's a simple example of querying for all users with a specific username:

```typescript
const usersWithUsername = await userRepository
  .createQueryBuilder('user')
  .where('user.username = :username', { username: 'example' })
  .getMany();
```

### Updating Data

Updating data is as simple as fetching a record, modifying it, and saving it back:

```typescript
const userToUpdate = await userRepository.findOne({ id: 1 });
userToUpdate.username = 'new-username';
await userRepository.save(userToUpdate);
```

### Deleting Data

Deleting records is also straightforward:

```typescript
await userRepository.delete({ id: 1 });
```

These are just a few basic examples of how you can use TypeORM in your project. Dive into the [TypeORM documentation](https://typeorm.io/) for more advanced features, such as relationships, migrations, transactions, and custom queries. TypeORM's intuitive API will help you handle complex database interactions with ease.



## Configuration

Configuring TypeORM is an essential step to connect your application with your chosen database. The configuration is typically managed through the `ormconfig.json` file in the root of your project. In this section, we'll guide you through the process of setting up the configuration.

### Creating the Configuration File

To create the configuration file, follow these steps:

1. Create a new file named `ormconfig.json` in your project's root directory.

2. Populate the file with the required configuration options. Here's a basic example:

```json
{
  "type": "postgres",
  "host": "localhost",
  "port": 5432,
  "username": "your-username",
  "password": "your-password",
  "database": "your-database",
  "entities": ["dist/entities/*.js"],
  "synchronize": true
}
```

- `"type"`: Specify the type of database you're using (e.g., `"postgres"`, `"mysql"`, `"sqlite"`).

- `"host"`: The hostname or IP address of the database server.

- `"port"`: The port number the database server listens on.

- `"username"` and `"password"`: Your database credentials.

- `"database"`: The name of the database you're connecting to.

- `"entities"`: An array of paths to your entity files. Use this to specify the location of your entity classes.

- `"synchronize"`: Set to `true` during development to auto-create or update the database schema based on your entity definitions. Disable this in production.

### Advanced Configuration

The basic configuration outlined above should work for most projects. However, TypeORM provides a wealth of additional configuration options to fine-tune your setup. These include:

- Connection pooling
- Logging
- Migrations
- Cache
- Subscribers
- ...and more

Refer to the [TypeORM Configuration](https://typeorm.io/#/using-ormconfig) documentation for an in-depth explanation of each option and advanced configurations.

Remember to securely manage sensitive information such as database credentials. You can use environment variables, configuration files outside of version control, or other secure methods.

Once your configuration is set up, you're ready to start using TypeORM to interact with your database. Enjoy the power and simplicity of TypeORM's database management capabilities!




## Database Setup

Before you start working with your application's data using TypeORM, you'll need to set up the database. This involves creating the necessary database, defining its schema, and configuring your TypeORM entities to match.

### 1. Create the Database

Depending on the database type you've chosen (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite), follow the appropriate steps to create a new database. You can use the command-line tools provided by your chosen database management system or a graphical interface.

### 2. Configuration Update

Make sure your `ormconfig.json` (or equivalent configuration file) contains accurate database connection details, including the database name, host, port, username, and password.

Here's a reminder of what your `ormconfig.json` might look like:

```json
{
  "type": "postgres",
  "host": "localhost",
  "port": 5432,
  "username": "your-username",
  "password": "your-password",
  "database": "your-database",
  "entities": ["dist/entities/*.js"],
  "synchronize": true
}
```

### 3. Entity Definitions

Your entities define the structure of your database tables and their relationships. Make sure your entity classes are defined according to your database schema.

For example, if you have a `User` entity:

```typescript
import { Entity, Column, PrimaryGeneratedColumn } from 'typeorm';

@Entity()
class User {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  id: number;

  @Column()
  username: string;

  // ... other columns and relationships
}
```

Ensure your entities' properties match the columns in your database tables.

### 4. Synchronization

During development, you can enable the `"synchronize": true` option in your configuration. This automatically creates or updates the database schema based on your entity definitions whenever your application starts.

```json
{
  // ... other configuration options
  "synchronize": true
}
```

**Note:** Be cautious with this setting in production, as it can lead to data loss if not used carefully. In production, consider using migrations to manage schema changes.

### 5. Run Your Application

With your database set up, configurations in place, and entity definitions ready, you're now ready to run your application. TypeORM will handle the connections and interactions with your database according to your entity definitions.

Remember that while TypeORM streamlines the process, it's essential to have a solid understanding of your database schema and design to ensure your application's data integrity and performance.



## Models

Models in TypeORM are represented by TypeScript classes that define the structure of your database tables. Each model maps to a table, and its properties represent columns. Models can also include relationships with other models.

### Creating a Model

To create a model, define a TypeScript class and decorate it with the appropriate TypeORM decorators. For example, let's create a simple `Product` model:

```typescript
import { Entity, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, Column } from 'typeorm';

@Entity()
class Product {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  id: number;

  @Column()
  name: string;

  @Column()
  price: number;
}
```

In this example, the `@Entity()` decorator marks the class as an entity, while `@PrimaryGeneratedColumn()` and `@Column()` decorators define the primary key and columns.

### Relationships

TypeORM makes it easy to define relationships between models. Consider a scenario where a `Product` belongs to a `Category`:

```typescript
import { Entity, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, Column, ManyToOne } from 'typeorm';
import { Category } from './Category'; // Import the related model

@Entity()
class Product {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  id: number;

  @Column()
  name: string;

  @Column()
  price: number;

  @ManyToOne(() => Category, category => category.products)
  category: Category;
}
```

In this example, the `@ManyToOne()` decorator establishes a many-to-one relationship between `Product` and `Category` entities.

### Inheritance

TypeORM also supports inheritance, allowing you to create base classes and extend them for specific models. Here's a simplified example:

```typescript
import { Entity, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, Column } from 'typeorm';

@Entity()
class BaseEntity {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  id: number;

  // ... common columns or properties
}

@Entity()
class User extends BaseEntity {
  @Column()
  username: string;

  // ... other user-specific columns
}
```

In this case, `User` extends `BaseEntity`, inheriting its properties.

### Advanced Options

Models offer a plethora of advanced options and decorators for defining indexes, constraints, default values, and more. Explore the [TypeORM Entity Options](https://typeorm.io/#/entities) documentation for a comprehensive list.

With models, you define the blueprint of your database tables and their relationships. TypeORM's intuitive syntax and decorators enable you to effortlessly map your application's data structures to the database schema.



## Repositories

Repositories in TypeORM provide a structured and efficient way to interact with your database entities. They encapsulate database operations and allow you to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) actions as well as more advanced queries.

### Creating a Repository

To create a repository, use the `getRepository` function provided by TypeORM. For instance, if you have a `User` entity:

```typescript
import { getRepository } from 'typeorm';

const userRepository = getRepository(User);
```

### Basic CRUD Operations

Repositories make basic CRUD operations a breeze. Here are some examples:

```typescript
// Creating a new user
const newUser = userRepository.create({ username: 'example' });
await userRepository.save(newUser);

// Finding users
const users = await userRepository.find();

// Updating a user
const userToUpdate = await userRepository.findOne({ id: 1 });
userToUpdate.username = 'new-username';
await userRepository.save(userToUpdate);

// Deleting a user
await userRepository.delete({ id: 1 });
```

### Custom Queries

TypeORM's query builder empowers you to create complex queries programmatically. Here's an example of finding users with a specific role:

```typescript
const usersWithRole = await userRepository
  .createQueryBuilder('user')
  .where('user.role = :role', { role: 'admin' })
  .getMany();
```

### Transactions

Repositories support transactions, ensuring that a series of operations either all succeed or none do. Here's a basic example:

```typescript
await getManager().transaction(async transactionalEntityManager => {
  await transactionalEntityManager.save(User, newUser);
  await transactionalEntityManager.update(User, 2, { username: 'updated-username' });
});
```

### More Repository Methods

TypeORM repositories offer a variety of methods for querying, updating, and deleting data. Explore the [TypeORM Repository API](https://typeorm.io/#/repository-api) documentation for a comprehensive list of available methods.

Repositories streamline your database interactions, providing a structured approach to managing your application's data. Whether you're performing basic CRUD operations or crafting intricate queries, repositories are your tool of choice for efficient database access.

Certainly, here's a "Migrations" section for your TypeORM README:


## Migrations

Database schema changes are inevitable as your application evolves. TypeORM's migration feature allows you to manage these changes efficiently, ensuring that your database structure aligns with your entity definitions.

### Creating Migrations

To create a migration, use the TypeORM CLI or its API. The CLI provides a simple way to generate migrations based on changes in your entity files:

```bash
npx typeorm migration:create -n MyMigrationName
```

This command generates a new migration file with the provided name.

### Applying Migrations

Once you've created a migration, you can apply it to your database:

```bash
npx typeorm migration:run
```

This command runs all pending migrations and updates your database schema.

### Reverting Migrations

If needed, you can revert the last applied migration:

```bash
npx typeorm migration:revert
```

This command undoes the last applied migration.

### Managing Multiple Environments

TypeORM migrations can also handle multiple environments, such as development, testing, and production. Use the `--connection` option to specify a different connection from your `ormconfig.json`:

```bash
npx typeorm migration:run --connection test
```

### Seed Data and Migrations

Migrations can also include seed data for your database. Add seed data using the `insert` method within your migration's `up` method:

```typescript
export class SeedData1597622074505 implements MigrationInterface {
  public async up(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise<void> {
    await queryRunner.query(/* SQL queries for inserting seed data */);
  }

  // ... other methods
}
```

### Migrations API

If you prefer programmatic control over migrations, you can use TypeORM's API to create, run, and manage migrations. Refer to the [TypeORM Migrations API](https://typeorm.io/#/migrations-api) documentation for detailed guidance.

Migrations are a critical tool for maintaining your database's integrity as your application evolves. TypeORM's migration feature simplifies the process, ensuring that your database schema changes are handled seamlessly.


## Seed Data

Seed data plays a crucial role in populating your database with initial records for development or testing purposes. TypeORM allows you to incorporate seed data alongside your migrations to ensure your database starts with relevant data.

### Adding Seed Data to Migrations

To include seed data within your migrations, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Migration:** Generate a new migration using the TypeORM CLI or API. This migration will handle both schema changes and seed data insertion.

2. **Populate Seed Data:** Inside the migration's `up` method, use query runners to insert seed data into your tables:

```typescript
export class SeedData1628198266520 implements MigrationInterface {
  public async up(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise<void> {
    // Insert seed data into the 'users' table
    await queryRunner.query(`
      INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES ('user1', 'user1@example.com');
      INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES ('user2', 'user2@example.com');
      -- ... more seed data
    `);
  }

  public async down(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise<void> {
    // Revert the seed data changes if needed
  }
}
```

3. **Run the Migration:** Run the migration using the TypeORM CLI to apply the schema changes and insert the seed data:

```bash
npx typeorm migration:run
```

### Using a Seeder Script

Another approach is to create a separate seeder script that populates the database. This approach can be useful when working with larger datasets or when you need more control over the seeding process:

1. **Create a Seeder Script:** In a designated script (e.g., `seed.ts`), use your repositories to insert seed data:

```typescript
import { createConnection } from 'typeorm';
import { User } from './entities/User'; // Import your entity classes

async function seed() {
  const connection = await createConnection();

  const userRepo = connection.getRepository(User);

  const newUser = userRepo.create({ username: 'seeded-user', email: 'seeded@example.com' });
  await userRepo.save(newUser);

  // ... insert more seed data
}

seed()
  .then(() => console.log('Seeding complete!'))
  .catch(error => console.error('Seeding error:', error));
```

2. **Run the Seeder Script:** Execute the seeder script to populate the database:

```bash
ts-node seed.ts
```

### Best Practices

- Keep your seed data small and focused on essential records for development and testing.
- Update your seed data as your application's requirements evolve.
- Use migrations and seeders together to ensure a consistent database state.

Seed data ensures that your database starts with relevant records, making it easier to develop and test your application. Choose the approach that best suits your needs and maintain your seed data alongside your project's evolution.



## Queries

TypeORM's powerful query builder allows you to construct complex SQL queries in a programmatic, type-safe manner. This section will introduce you to some essential query-building techniques.

### Basic Querying

Here's how you can use the query builder to fetch data from the database:

```typescript
import { getRepository } from 'typeorm';

const userRepository = getRepository(User);

const users = await userRepository
  .createQueryBuilder('user')
  .where('user.age > :age', { age: 25 })
  .orderBy('user.username', 'ASC')
  .getMany();
```

In this example, we retrieve users older than 25 and order them by username.

### Joining Tables

TypeORM makes joining tables intuitive:

```typescript
const usersWithRoles = await userRepository
  .createQueryBuilder('user')
  .leftJoinAndSelect('user.roles', 'role')
  .getMany();
```

This query fetches users along with their associated roles.

### Aggregations

You can perform aggregations like counting, summing, or averaging:

```typescript
const userCount = await userRepository
  .createQueryBuilder('user')
  .select('COUNT(user.id)', 'count')
  .getRawOne();
```

This query returns the count of users.

### Subqueries

Subqueries allow you to nest queries within queries:

```typescript
const highSpendingUsers = await userRepository
  .createQueryBuilder('user')
  .where(`user.id IN (${subQuery.getQuery()})`)
  .setParameter('maxSpending', 1000)
  .getMany();
```

Here, `subQuery` is a separate query that fetches user IDs with high spending.

### Transactions

Wrap multiple queries in a transaction for atomicity:

```typescript
await getManager().transaction(async transactionalEntityManager => {
  await transactionalEntityManager.save(User, newUser);
  await transactionalEntityManager.delete(User, { id: 2 });
});
```

### More Query Building

These are just a few examples of what you can achieve with TypeORM's query builder. Explore the [TypeORM Query Builder](https://typeorm.io/#/select-query-builder) documentation for more methods and advanced techniques.

TypeORM's query builder gives you the tools to construct sophisticated queries while maintaining strong typing and code readability. Whether you need simple data retrieval or complex aggregations, the query builder has you covered.


## Advanced Tips

As you become more comfortable with TypeORM, consider these advanced tips to enhance your experience and optimize your database interactions.

### 1. Use Transactions Wisely

Transactions ensure the atomicity of a series of database operations. Wrap related operations in a transaction to guarantee that they all succeed or fail together:

```typescript
await getManager().transaction(async transactionalEntityManager => {
  await transactionalEntityManager.save(User, newUser);
  await transactionalEntityManager.delete(User, { id: 2 });
});
```

### 2. Utilize Caching

TypeORM supports caching, reducing the need to hit the database frequently. Configure caching for frequently accessed data to improve performance:

```typescript
await userRepository.find({
  cache: true,
  cacheId: 'my-cache-key',
  cacheTime: 60000 // Cache expiration time in milliseconds
});
```

### 3. Optimize Queries

Leverage TypeORM's query builder to construct efficient queries. Use indexing, limit the selected columns, and avoid excessive joins to improve query performance.

### 4. Handle Large Datasets

For handling large datasets, consider pagination and filtering. Use the `take` and `skip` methods to implement pagination:

```typescript
const pageSize = 10;
const pageNumber = 2;
const users = await userRepository.find({
  take: pageSize,
  skip: pageSize * (pageNumber - 1)
});
```

### 5. Migrations and Continuous Integration

In a continuous integration environment, consider running migrations automatically before running tests to ensure that the database schema is up to date:

```bash
npx typeorm migration:run
npm test
```

### 6. Utilize Migration Scripts

For tasks beyond simple schema changes, create migration scripts that modify data or perform complex operations during migrations:

```typescript
export class DataMigration1597622074505 implements MigrationInterface {
  public async up(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise<void> {
    await queryRunner.query('UPDATE users SET active = true WHERE lastLogin > NOW() - INTERVAL 6 MONTH');
  }

  public async down(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise<void> {
    // Revert the data changes if needed
  }
}
```
